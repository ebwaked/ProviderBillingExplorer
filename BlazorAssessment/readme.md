### üß± Requirements

1. **Download & Parse CSV**
    - Download the latest ZIP file containing the CSV
    - Extract and parse the CSV file
    - Rename csv to data.csv
    - Copy file to C:\data.csv
    - Alternitively you can adjust the file path and csv name at the top of Program.cs
2. **Run DataIngestionConsole**
    - Run the console app to ingest the data
    - Should take 5-7 minutes
    - If hardware is an issue adjust batch size to 1000 or 10000 to reduce memory usage
    - That will increase time to around 15-20 minutes
